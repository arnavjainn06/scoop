## üïπÔ∏è Motive / Vision
<p align="left">
  Over the last three years, with the rise of "tiktoks" and "reels", the swipe down method to scroll through content has grown a lot. People prefer it because it offers a unique and handy way to find something you like. I reviewd a few news apps before I sat down to create the template design for this app. A lot of them featured the "swipe down for more" idea but they were all limited to their particular sources and did not offer clean/minimal UI. Scoop has a collections from almost every source in the world and aims to provide you with all the information you need to stay up to date.
